I am a data scientist currently working at AXA Ireland, where I focus on Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

I hold a PhD from University College Dublin, where I researched ways to use satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor progress toward Goal 11.1 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This goal aims to detect and estimate the population living in deprived areas around the world.

Beyond my research and professional projects, I enjoy sharing knowledge and fostering learning. I regularly teach machine learning topics and supervise Master’s students, helping to guide the next generation of ML and AI specialists.

Inspired by the <a href='https://mlcollective.org/'>ML Collective</a>, I offer free public office hours once a week. These sessions can be booked <a href='google.com'>here</a>, and I’d be happy to discuss ideas, answer questions, or explore collaboration opportunities.
