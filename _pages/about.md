I am a machine learning researcher, currently pursuing a PhD at University College Dublin. In my research, I investigate methods to employ satellite imagery and machine learning algorithms to keep track of goal 11.1 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This goal seeks to estimate the population living in deprived areas around the world. My focus has been on developing techniques that can work at scale, are cost effective and robust to the noisiness and scarcity of labels in sustainable development applications. 

Prior to my PhD, I did lots of interesting things such as managing multi-million-dollar projects and working offshore. I occasionally teach modules related to data science and mentor master students.
