  abstract = {Over a billion people live in slums in settlements that are often located in ecologically sensitive areas and hence highly vulnerable. This is a problem in many parts of the world, but it is more prominent in low-income countries, where in 2014 on average 65\% of the urban population lived in slums. As a result, building resilient communities requires quantifying the population living in these deprived areas and improving their living conditions. However, most of the data about slums comes from census data, which is only available at aggregate levels and often excludes these settlements. Consequently, researchers have looked at alternative approaches. These approaches, however, commonly rely on expensive high-resolution satellite imagery and field-surveys, which hinders their large-scale applicability. In this paper, we investigate a cost-effective methodology to estimate the slum population by assessing the quality of gridded population data. We evaluate the accuracy of the WorldPOP and LandScan population layers against ground-truth data composed of 1,703 georeferenced polygons that were mapped as deprived areas and which had their population surveyed during the 2010 Brazilian census. While the LandScan data did not produce satisfactory results for most polygons, the WorldPOP estimates were less than 20\% off for 67\% of the polygons and the overall error for the totality of the studied area was only -5.9\%. This small error margin demonstrates that population layers with a resolution of at least a 100m, such as WorldPOP's, can be useful tools to estimate the population living in slums.},

  abstract = {The UN-Habitat estimates that over one billion people live in slums around the world. However, state-of-the-art techniques to detect the location of slum areas employ high-resolution satellite imagery, which is costly to obtain and process. As a result, researchers have started to look at utilising free and open-access medium resolution satellite imagery. Yet, there is no clear consensus on which data preparation and machine learning approaches are the most appropriate to use with such imagery data. In this paper, we evaluate two techniques (multi-spectral data and grey-level co-occurrence matrix feature extraction) on an open-access dataset consisting of labelled Sentinel-2 images with a spatial resolution of 10 meters. Both techniques were paired with a canonical correlation forests classifier. The results show that the grey-level co-occurrence matrix performed better than multi-spectral data for all four cities. It had an average accuracy for the slum class of 97\% and a mean intersection over union of 94\%, while multi-spectral data had 75\% and 64\% for the respective metrics. These results indicate that open-access satellite imagery with a resolution of at least 10 meters may be suitable for keeping track of development goals such as the detection of slums in cities.},
