  abstract = {Many real-world problems present challenges that still have not been solved by the machine learning community, despite the high availability of satellite imagery and recent advances in computer vision. In particular, techniques which are cheaper and less reliant on large data sets are needed to map slums in cities. This study presents preliminary results using deep learning feature extraction followed by clustering using k-means, an unsupervised method, to detect slums in Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The clusters that represented deprived areas in cities are identified using a data set which contains information about the topology of the urban areas derived from crowd-sourced digital maps. Overall, the unsupervised method performed worse than the baseline, a fine-tuned ResNet18 model (a supervised approach). The mean Intersection over Union for the two investigated locations (Mumbai and Capetown) was 0.46 and 0.51 for the supervised model, and 0.27 and 0.31 for the unsupervised model. Results suggest that other strategies for dealing with such imbalanced data sets need to be investigated to improve the results obtained for the slum class, and also strategies to automatically identify the clusters that represent deprived areas/slums.
